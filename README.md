- Preprocessed and analyzed the experimental data using **Python** tools (**Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**), and visualized players’ animations using celluloid (Python package).

**Opinion Polarization in Online Social Networks**
- Contributed to construct a theoretical model, which combines endogenous network formation setup and personalization mechanism, to investigate the effect of personalization on polarization.
- Collaborated to develop **Python simulations**, testing diverse parameters to forecast patterns and trends in opinion evolution and polarization levels.
- Designed, coded, and conducted lab experiments using **oTree** and **Javascript** to validate simulation outcomes with experimental results.
- Preprocessed and engineered features for experimental data using **Python** tools (**Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**), and applied **statistical methods** including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and probit models to analyze player connection patterns and interpret the relationship between personalization and polarization.

**The Effects of Democracy: Equality and Fairness**
- Designed a robust **experiment** to analyze the impacts of democracy, rigorously controlling for self-selection biases and information effects to avoid confounding factors.
- Engineered and executed the experiment using **oTree** and **JavaScript**, deployed via **Heroku**, engaging over 700 participants representative of the U.S. population to secure a diverse and comprehensive dataset.
- Developed and implemented a data preprocessing **pipeline** that incorperated experimental data with demographics, enabling nuanced analysis of democracy's effects segmented by age and education levels.
- Employed advanced **statistical models**, including linear regression, logistic regression, and probit models, to rigorously test, quantify, and visualize the effects of democracy across various treatment groups.

**Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews with NLP and ML Models**
- Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing and EDA using **PySpark DataFrame** and **SQL** on over 7 million Yelp reviews, identifying key trends and top-performing restaurants based on review volume and ratings, setting a robust foundation for subsequent analyses.
- Architected and implemented an advanced **NLP pipeline** with **PySpark** to process and clean Yelp's large-scale review data, incorporating techniques such as tokenization, normalization, lemmatization, and stopword removal, followed by feature engineering with **HashingTF** and **IDF**.
- Developed, trained, and evaluated multiple **machine learning** models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosted Trees, and SVM) to predict user sentiment from reviews, achieving an initial accuracy of over 80% on a diverse and extensive dataset.
- Optimized model performance through rigorous **hyperparameter tuning** using **Cross Validation** and **Grid Search**, improving accuracy by 10%; effectively scaled the deployment of the best-performing model to enhance real-time sentiment analysis capabilities for Yelp review data.
