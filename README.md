## Ongoing Research Projects

**Self-Enforcing Cycles in Large Timing Games**
- Developed a **game theory model** to analyze strategic behavior in timing competitive actions, enhancing understanding of market entry and exit strategies.
- Conducted **simulations** in **Python**, employing various plausible adaptive dynamics, to assess the stability of model prediction. Implemented a robust optimization **pipeline** that enhanced simulation efficiency by 50%. 
- Designed, implemented and conducted an interactive **lab experiment** using oTree (Python package) and **Javascript** to validate model predictions against actual human behavior.
- Preprocessed and analyzed the experimental data using **Python** tools (**Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**), and visualized playersâ€™ animations using celluloid (Python package).

**Opinion Polarization in Online Social Networks**
- Contributed to construct a theoretical model, which combines endogenous network formation setup and personalization mechanism, to investigate the effect of personalization on polarization.
- Collaborated to develop **Python simulations**, testing diverse parameters to forecast patterns and trends in opinion evolution and polarization levels.
- Designed, coded, and conducted lab experiments using oTree (Python package) and Javascript to validate simulation outcomes with experimental results.
- Managed the cleaning and analysis of experimental data using Python tools (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

**The Effects of Democracy: Equality and Fairness**
- Proposed a realistic experiment to investigate the effect of democracy when when rigorously controling for self-selection biases and information effects.
- Designed and coded the lab experiment using oTree (Python package), and conducted experiments with more than 700 subjects.
- Cleaned and evaluated the effect of democracy by using linear regression, logistic regression and probit model.

**Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews with NLP and ML Models**
- Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing and EDA using **PySpark DataFrame** and **SQL** on over 7 million Yelp reviews, identifying key trends and top-performing restaurants based on review volume and ratings, setting a robust foundation for subsequent analyses.
- Architected and implemented an advanced **NLP pipeline** with **PySpark** to process and clean Yelp's large-scale review data, incorporating techniques such as tokenization, normalization, lemmatization, and stopword removal, followed by feature engineering with **HashingTF** and **IDF** vectorization.
- Developed, trained, and evaluated multiple **machine learning** models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosted Trees, and SVM) to predict user sentiment from reviews, achieving an initial accuracy of over 80% on a diverse and extensive dataset.
- Optimized model performance through rigorous **hyperparameter tuning** using **Cross Validation** and **Grid Search**, improving accuracy by 10%; effectively scaled the deployment of the best-performing model to enhance real-time sentiment analysis capabilities for Yelp review data.

## Work Experience
**Teaching Assistant @ Economics Department, UC Santa Cruz (_Jan 2020 - Present_)**
